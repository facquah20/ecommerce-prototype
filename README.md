# ecommerce-prototype
This is a prototype of an Ecommerce website I'm building using JavaScript

The main folder comprises of Backend and Frontend subfolders
The backend folder contains files that interacts with json files in the directory
Index.js is the entry file of the backend code. It contains the url that the frontend will use.

# Libraries used
Since the project is a protoype no external libraries were used, that is, the core node modules were used
No database was used as well other than the json files found in my backend directory

# How to start the backend Server
To start the backend server first navigate to the backend directory by running "cd backend"
Then, run "node index.js"
This will start the server from at the port in your environment variables or port 3000.

# Endpoints
All the endpoints of server can be found in the index.js file. You can test them using postman
